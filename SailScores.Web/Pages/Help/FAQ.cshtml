          <div class="faq-details-content">
              <p>
                  Absolutely! You can score and view races from a laptop, tablet, or phone—right from
                  the dock or the committee boat. Just make sure you’re connected to the
                  internet and have a modern browser.

          <div class="faq-details-content">
              <p>
                  Yes. SailScores is cloud-based, so you’ll need an internet connection
                  to enter results and publish scores. Offline support is on our radar,
                  but not available yet.

          <summary class="h4">What scoring methods are supported?</summary>
          <div class="faq-details-content">
              <p>
                  SailScores supports a range of scoring systems:
                  <ul>
                      <li>Appendix A low point (with and without rule 5.3)</li>
                      <li>Appendix A with modified first place values</li>
                      <li>High Point Percentage</li>
                      <li>Low Point Average</li>
                      <li>Cox-Sprague</li>
                  </ul>
                  You can tailor all score codes to match
                  your club’s requirements, such as custom volunteer or DNC values.
              </p>
                <p>
                    For all scoring methods, you can set custom calculations for the
                    standard codes, or you can create custom codes, such
                    "VOL - Volunteer Race Committee."
                </p>
              <p>
                  SailScores is aligned with the 2025–2028 Racing Rules of Sailing,
                  including updates to rounding and scoring penalties.
              </p>

            <summary class="h4">Does SailScores support handicap or heat-based race results?</summary>>
            <div class="faq-details-content">
                <p>
                  No. While SailScores currently will capture the times of finishers and can publish them,
                  it does not yet apply handicaps. If handicap results are calculated in another system,
                  the finishers can be ordered correctly in SailScores for publishing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Combining race results for heats or team racing is also on the development roadmap, but
                    not yet implemented.

            <div class="faq-details-content">
                <p>
                    Absolutely! SailScores supports both long-running
                    series (like a summer club series) and short regattas.
                    Run them side by side within the same season.

                    Yes. Multiple accounts can share the scorekeeping responsibilities
                    within a club. They’ll be able to enter results, manage events,
                    and help keep things running smoothly.

                <p>
                    Nope. Competitors don’t need to log in to view

                    manage the site.

                <p>
                    Definitely. You can create a club and try out scoring,
                    fleets, and formats. It’s a great way to get familiar
                    with the system before race day.
                    <a href="mailto:info@SailScores.com">Let us know</a> if
                    we'd like some of the tests cleared out.

                <p>
                    You can keep your club unlisted and still share
                    direct links to results with your members. It’s a good
                    option for testing or demonstrations. The links won't be
                    pushed to search engines, but they'll be freely accessible
                    to anyone with the link.

                    enter results; or find the microphone icon to use voice input for sail numbers.
                    When using voice recognition, say a sail number or sailor name as it appears
                    in the competitor list. Pause briefly between entries. The letters of a score
                    code (e.g. "OCS"") will apply to the last added score.

                <p>
                    yes. Mark a race in a series as provisional to display the series scores with a note indicating
                    the scores are not final. When ready, update that race status to “Raced”. SailScores
                    automatically recalculates series results when a race is saved.

                <p>
                    Ties for most scoring methods follow World Sailing RRS Appendix A rules. A couple of
                    base scoring systems, such as <b>PWA Standard</b>, have different tie-breaking rules.

            <div class="faq-details-content">
                <p>
                    The total before discards is not used in scoring according to Appendix A. Discarded scores
                    are not used in most of the tie-breakers. In our experience, a "Total" column
                    creates confusion for those new to Appendix A scoring, particularly when it doesn't
                    match the tie-breaker results.

                    Each scoring system has discard rules, describing the number of discards
                    after <i>X</i> races are sailed. A club can have many different scoring
                    systems set up. Typically, clubs will have a regatta scoring
                    system and a club sailing scoring system with different discard rules
                    and different custom score codes.

                <p>
                    Any collection of races to be scored together is a "Series" in SailScores.
                    A regatta is an event, which will include a series for each fleet of boats
                    participating. Regatta home pages have a dedicated scoring page which
                    displays notices, documents for all and results for each fleet.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A regatta race will automatically include a result for every competitor
                    in the fleet, while a non-regatta series won't add results for anyone
                    that wasn't added explicitly. But scoring will assume DNC for missing
                    competitors.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When setting up or entering results for a regatta, make sure to use the
                    New Race and New Fleet buttons from the regatta scoring page. This will
                    establish the link to the event.
