<h1>Getting Started</h1>
<p>
  This page covers the basic steps after a club is first created: from the
    first look at the SailScores club page to the entry of races. It
    doesn't aim to cover every option.

        <p>How terms are used in SailScores.</p>

        <dl class="row">
          <dt>Club</dt>
          <dd>
            All results in SailScores belong to a club. The elements of scoring are setup at the
            Club level and can be shared across Series and Races within the club.
          </dd>

          <dt>Competitor</dt>
          <dd>
            A sailor or boat entered into a race. Sail number is the most commonly used method for
            entering results, but the alternative sail number and competitor name may also be used
            in some circumstances.
          </dd>

          <dt>Season</dt>
          <dd>
            Series and Regattas belong to a Season. Seasons are typically a year long, and Series
            will repeat each year, in a new Season. The dates of a Season are important:
            races can only belong to series assigned to a season including the date of the race.
          </dd>

          <dt>Series</dt>
          <dd>
            A set of races grouped for scoring. Results are recalculated when a race within the
            Series is edited. Races can be in multiple series. These are the most frequently viewed
            items in SailScores.
          </dd>

          <dt>Race</dt>
          <dd>
            A race is a start and results for a group of boats scored against each other. These are
            the most frequently edited items in SailScores.
          </dd>

          <dt>Regatta</dt>
          <dd>
            A group of Series for difference fleets that share the same scoring rules and where
            results will be shared on the same page. Usually only a few days long.
          </dd>

          <dt>Scoring System</dt>
          <dd>
            Scoring Systems are the instructions to combind multiple races into series results. The
            most common Scoring Systems are based on the Racing Rules of Sailing Appendix A. Score
            Codes and Discard rules are setup within a Scoring System. Scoring System calculations,
            such as tie-breaking, averaging, and totals are defined in a base Scoring System.
            SailScores supports a number of base Scoring Systems such as Appendix A, Low Point
            Average, Cox-Sprague, High Point Percent, and others.
          </dd>

          <dt>Score Codes</dt>
          <dd>
            Often three letters, Score Codes can be entered as race results to indicate special
            circumstances, such as Did Not Finish, On-Course Start, or Did Not Start. Clubs often
            set up custom codes or change the calculation of the usual score codes, such as Race
            Committee duty. Score Codes provide a scoring value as set in the Scoring System
            assigned to a series.

        <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
        <p>
          Before following the instructions below you should have an account on
          SailScores.com and completed a request for a SailScores club, after which you'll get an
          emailed response with instructions on accessing your club's home page.
        </p>
        <p>
          You should also have a modern web browser. Most functions work well on a phone, tablet
          or PC. A larger screen can make the initial set-up a little easier as you'll see more
          details together.
        </p>
        <p>
          For the quickest setup, be ready:
          <ul>
            <li>
              Know your club's usual scoring rules: what system is used, what custom codes are
              defined, and what's the usual discard pattern?
            </li>
            <li>
              Have a list of competitors, including sail number, boat class and, optionally, boat
              name.
            </li>
            <li>
              To set up automatic retrieval of day of race weather, know your club's latitude and
              longitude. (Right-clicking in popular map websites will usually show this.)
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h3>Step 1 — Make yourself at home</h3>
        <p>
          The email indicating that your club has been created will include a link to your club's
          SailScores Home Page. This page is worth bookmarking. It is the starting point for
          scorekeepers and result viewers. Feel free to share links to other pages, the links
          should be stable and work for a long time. But if you need one link to share, it will be
          to the SailScores Club Home Page. This link address ends with your club's initials, and
          will be the start of other links for your club's results.

        <h3>Step 2 — One Time Club Configuration</h3>
        <p>
          There are a few settings to confirm when you first get access to a club.
          These can be changed later, but usually they can be ignored after initial setup.
        </p>

        <h4 class="mt-3">Confirm General Club settings</h4>
        <p>
          Open the Club Admin page and then click on <strong>Edit Club Info</strong>. Verify the club name,
          club URL, and location details. Enter latitude and longitude so that SailScores
          can get the current conditions for your races.

        <h4 class="mt-3">Add Classes</h4>
        <p>
          Create the boat classes (e.g., Laser, Optimist, 470) used by your club. Classes
          filter entries and help gather statistics. Every competitor will be assigned to
          one class.

          If you are testing out SailScores, you can skip this and customize the scoring
          later. Scoring Systems are
          defined towards the bottom of the Club Admin page. The most common change
          is to the discard pattern. You can edit it to match your club's published rules.
          Add any custom scoring codes that your club uses.

        <h3>Step 3 — Recurring Series and Competitor Setup</h3>
        <p>
          Set up the recurring items and register competitors so race entry is quick and
          repeatable. You'll come back to these activities every so often.

                    <h4 class="alert-heading">Understanding seasons</h4>
                    <p>
                        Every series and regatta in SailScores belongs to a <strong>season</strong>. Most of the links
                        to your club's results will include a season in the URL, which keeps years of results organized
                        and easy to navigate.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Many clubs use calendar years (e.g., “2026”) or hyphenated years in the southern hemisphere
                        (e.g., “25–26”). You can define any date range that fits your schedule. Choose an interval that
                        covers the races in your series; often the same series name will repeat each season.
                    </p>
                    <p class="mb-0">
                        Before entering results, make sure there is a season whose dates cover every race you plan to
                        record. You can always add additional seasons later if your plans change.
                    </p>
                </div>

        <h4 class="mt-3">Season setup</h4>
        <p>
          Create a Season (typically a year) and set the date range. Seasons provide the
          container for Series and Events and limit how races can be grouped together. Don't
          worry about making the series longer than your sailing season. The season start and
          end dates don't get displayed on the site. For a club that sails during the Northern
          summer, set the season dates to January 1 to December 31, even if there
          are never races in winter.

        <p>
          Create Series (weekly league, summer series, regatta series). For now, leave the
          Series Type set to <strong>Standard</strong>. <strong>Summary Series</strong>
          can automatically roll-up other
          series results into a aggregated score. But you'll need to have Standard Series
          before you can use those.
