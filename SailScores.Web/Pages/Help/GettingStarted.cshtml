    <p>Common terms used in this guide.</p>

    <dl class="row">
        <dt>Club</dt>
        <dd>All results in SailScores belong to a club. The elements of scoring are setup
          at the Club level and can be shared across Series and Races within the club.
        </dd>
        <dt>Season</dt>
        <dd>
            Series and Regattas belong to one Season. Seasons are typically a year long, and Series will
            repeat each year, in a new season. The date range of a season is important: races can
            belong to series in the season of their date.
        </dd>

        <dt>Series</dt>
        <dd>A set of races grouped for scoring. Results are recalculated when a race within the
          Series is edited. Races can be in multiple series.</dd>

        <dt>Race</dt>
        <dd>A race is a start and results for a group of boats scored against each other. These are
          added and edited frequently during typical SailScores use.</dd>

        <dt>Competitor</dt>
        <dd>A sailor or boat entered into a race. Sail number is the most commonly
          used method for entering results, but the alternative sail number and competitor name may
          also be used in some circumstances.</dd>

        <dt>Scoring System</dt>
        <dd>Scoring Systems provide the instructions for how the scores for multiple races will
          be combined to give the series results. The most common Scoring Systems are based on
          the Racing Rules of Sailing Appendix A. Score Codes and Discard rules are setup within a
          Scoring System. Scoring System calculations, such as tie-breaking, averaging, and totals
          are defined in a base Scoring System. SailScores supports a number of base Scoring Systems
          such as Appendix A, Low Point Average, Cox-Sprague, High Point Percent, and others.
        </dd>

        <dt>Score Codes</dt>
        <dd>Often three letters, Score Codes can be entered as race results to
          indicate special circumstances, such as Did Not Finish, On-Course Start, or Did Not Start.
          Clubs often set up custom codes or change the calculation of the usual score codes, such
          as Race Committee duty, or VOLunteer work. Score Codes provide a scoring value as set in
          the Scoring System assigned to a series.</dd>

                <h2>Overview</h2>
                <p>This guide walks through the basic workflow after a club is first created: from the first look at
                  the SailScores club page to the entry of races. It does not aim to explain or explore all options.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h2>Prerequisites</h2>
                <p>
                    Before following the instructions in this guide you should have an account on SailScores.com
                    and completed a request for a SailScores club, after which you'll get an emailed response with
                    instructions on accessing your club's home page.
                </p>
                <p>
                  You should also have a modern web browser. Most functions work well on a phone, tablet or PC. A
                  larger screen can make the initial set-up a little easier as you'll see more details together.
                </p>
                <p>
                  For the quickest setup, you should:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Know your club's usual scoring rules: what system is used, what custom codes are defined, and
                      what's the usual discard pattern?
                    </li>
                    <li>Have a list of competitors, including sail number, boat class and, optionally, boat name.</li>
                    <li>To set up automatic retrieval of day of race weather, know your club's latitude and longitude.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
            </section>

            <section class="mt-4">
              <h3>Step 1 — Make yourself at home</h3>
              <p>The email indicating that your club has been created will include a link to your club's SailScores
                  Home Page. This page is worth bookmarking. It is the starting point for scorekeepers and result
                  viewers. Feel free to share links to other pages, the links should be stable and work for a long time.
                But if you need one link to share, it will be to the SailScores Club Home Page. This link usually ends with
                your club's initials, which will be in all the other links for your club's results as well.

                <h3>Step 2 — One Time Club Configuration</h3>
                <p>This section covers the settings you should confirm when you first get access to a club. These can be changed
                  later, but they usually don't need to be changed frequently.</p>

                <h4 class="mt-3">Confirm General Club settings</h4>
                <p>Open the Club Admin page and verify the club name, contact email, default time zone, and location details. These values are used on public pages and in some report headers.</p>
                <figure class="figure">

                <h4 class="mt-3">Add Classes</h4>
                <p>Define the boat classes (e.g., Laser, Optimist, 470) used by your club. Classes are used to filter entries and to compute class-based series results.</p>

                </figure>

                <h4 class="mt-3">Confirm Scoring System</h4>
                <p>Choose or confirm the default Scoring System for your club (for example Appendix A / Low Point). Ensure score codes and discard rules match your club's published rules. You can edit or create custom scoring systems if required.</p>

                <h3>Step 3 — Recurring Series and Competitor Setup</h3>
                <p>Set up the seasonal structures and register competitors so race entry is quick and repeatable.</p>

                <h4 class="mt-3">Season setup</h4>
                <p>Create a Season (typically a calendar year) and set the date range. Seasons provide the container for Series and Events and affect which series a race can belong to based on date.</p>

                <h4 class="mt-3">Series setup</h4>
                <p>Create Series (weekly league, summer series, regatta series) and assign the appropriate Scoring System, classes, and any series-specific rules such as allowed discards or minimum races to qualify.</p>

                <h4 class="mt-3">Competitor setup</h4>
                <p>Import or enter competitor records including sail number, name, and class. Keep competitor lists maintained so entering race results can often be done by selecting from the list rather than retyping information.</p>
