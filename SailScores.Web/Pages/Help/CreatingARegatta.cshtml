    Steps to create a regatta, configure fleets, and prepare for multi-day event scoring.
</p>

<section class="mt-3">
    <h2>Preparation</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure the regatta dates are within an existing Season or create a Season first.</li>
        <li>Decide fleets (by class or handicap) and the scoring system for each fleet.</li>
        <li>Gather competitor registration information (sail number, name, club).</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="mt-3">
    <h2>Create the regatta</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>From the Club Admin page locate the <strong>Regattas</strong> section and click <strong>New Regatta</strong>.</li>
        <li>Provide the regatta name, date range, and any high-level notes.</li>
        <li>Create Fleets for the regatta. Each fleet can have its own scoring options and competitor list.</li>
        <li>Add or import competitors into each fleet. You can also create competitors later from the regatta page.</li>
        <p>Each fleet has its own section on the regatta page, and the Competitors tab includes a button to add or edit the boats and crews assigned to that fleet.</p>
        <li>Create races for each fleet (single or multiple races per day) and set the scoring options (e.g., track times, racing area).</li>
    </ol>
</section>

<section class="mt-3">
    <h2>During the event</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Use the regatta page to enter results per fleet. Results for regattas are shown on a single regatta page with fleet tabs.</li>
        <li>For protests or changes, mark races provisional until resolved then save to trigger recalculation.</li>
        <li>Publish daily results from the regatta page so competitors can view standings as the event progresses.</li>
    </ul>
</section>

<section class="mt-3">
    <h2>After the regatta</h2>
    <p>
        Review final races, confirm all protests are resolved, then mark races as final so series/regatta standings are published without the provisional flag.
