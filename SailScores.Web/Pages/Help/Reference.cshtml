                SailScores is a web-based sailing scoring program designed to make every step of score entry and
                publication faster and easier than traditional methods. It’s ideal for club races with multiple
                series or overlapping events — for example, a single race might count toward both a Low Wind Series,
                a Club Championship, and the August Series without duplicate entry.

                    Club-oriented rather than single-event focused. Competitors are entered once, and then shared
                    across series and seasons.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Fully web-based — results are automatically published online, reducing steps for scorekeepers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Mobile-friendly — designed to work smoothly on phones and tablets without a keyboard for
                    scorekeepers as well viewers.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Multi-series support — easily assign a race to multiple series without re-entering data.

                <li>
                    No handicap, time-on-time or time-on-distance scoring — results are entered as ranked
                    finishes. It will currently work for handicap scoring if you calculate the finish order
                    elsewhere.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Limited crew/equipment fields — SailScores is not a boat or equipment management system.
                </li>
                <li>
                    No built-in competitor payment processing or self-service event registration. Regatta
                    fleets are updated by the scorekeepers.

                SailScores is particularly popular with clubs that have long running series
                with many races. The ease of score entry has also made it popular with
                groups running many races on a single day, such as radio control sailing

                    southern hemisphere they are more likely to be named like 2025-26

            <p>
                A regatta is a single event, often over one or a few days. A regatta has a dedicated scoring page
                that can display notices. A series is focused on the scores for a collection of races over a season
                or period. A regatta can include multiple fleets, but a series scores all included boats against
                each other.
            </p>
            <p>
                When setting up or entering results for a regatta, make sure to use the New Race and New Fleet
                buttons from the regatta scoring page. This will keep them linked to the regatta.

                Each scoring system has discard rules, describing the number of discards after x races are sailed.
                A club can have many different scoring systems set up. Typically, clubs will have a regatta scoring
                system and a club sailing scoring system with different discard rules and different
                custom score codes.
