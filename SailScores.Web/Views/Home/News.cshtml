</h3>
<h5>Release Notes</h5>
<p>
    Series can now show a column with change in competitors' rankings.
</p><p>
    Historical series can lock their results, so that changes in the scoring system or the races will no longer change the series.
</p>
<h3>
    August 10th, 2019 Update
</h3>
<h5>Release Notes</h5>
<p>
    Custom Scoring systems are now working.
    <ul>
        <li>
            Three base systems are currently implemented: Appendix A (a.k.a. low point)
            for Series, Appendix A for Regattas, and High Point Percentage.
        </li>
        <li>
            Clubs can implement custom scoring systems that derive from the base
            systems, but customize codes or the discard pattern.
        </li>
        <li>
            A club should have a default scoring system set. (It can be one of the
            built in systems.)
        </li>
        <li>Series can then be set to use a different system.</li>
    </ul>
    Also some enhancements have been made to support long series: helm name is now
    shown every 25 races and as the last column of the results.
</p>
<h5>Coming soon</h5>
<p>
    The next big feature on the way will be support for regattas: We are aiming
    to have this done in time to use SailScores for the LHYC fall Die Hard Regatta.
</p>
<p>
    Some other small enhancments on the way:
    <ul>
        <li>
            Indication if a skipper's ranking has
            gone up or down in the recent past with a trend indicator.
        </li>
        <li>
            Localization support: clubs can have a defined locale that will control
            display of dates and keywords can be translated.
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

    June 7th, 2019 Update
</h3>
<h5>Release Notes</h5>
<p>
    Enhancements to the race editing page are getting rolled out today:
    <ul>
        <li>
            The page automatically scrolls to show the last entered result. (This
            required that the Add Result field get moved toward the bottom of the page.)
        </li>
        <li>
            A few weeks ago we added a field to track scheduled, raced and abandoned
            races. Scheduled and abandoned races don't show up in series views on small
            devices and aren't used for scoring.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Name and Description fields have been moved to Additional Fields section
            that is collapse by default.
        </li>
        <li>
            The format of the result list has been improved, including more details
            score codes.
        </li>
    </ul>
    These changes should make entering results on a phone a much better experience. The changes came
    about after using this with great success for the last several weeks at Lake Harriet.
</p>
<h5>Other News</h5>
<p>
    We're trying to consolidate our issues lists with the SailScores code at
    <a href="https://github.com/jbfraser1/SailScores/issues" target="_blank">GitHub.</a> Some
    of the issues have a "Help wanted" tag, where we'd love to hear more input from potential users.
</p>
<p>
    The big effort of making the scoring systems customizable through a user interface has started.
    Initially this will focus on supporting low-point scoring, and allowing for customizable
    discard patterns and score code values, but still making sure a single race can be used in
    multiple series.

    SailScores.com is kinda live. There are still features to be added, but the basics are
    working. In the next few months there will be plenty of testing and tweaks. Hopefully
    a few new features as well. If you are interested in helping out with the testing, please
    <a href="mailto:info@sailscores.com">reach out</a> and let us know.
