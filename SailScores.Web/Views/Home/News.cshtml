    <h3>February 12th, 2025</h3>
    <h5>Formatting tweak</h5>
    <p>
        A few minor updates to display formatting. The biggest of these is that we now use the race name in more places, including
        the header of series results. Race description still shows up when clicking through. When testing this, it looks like the
        trade off of wider race score columns is worth it to get the extra info for the clubs that use race names.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>January 23rd, 2025</h3>
    <h5>Racing Rules of Sailing 2025-2028</h5>
    <p>
        In addition to some minor changes to a few scoring codes, RRS 2025-2028 also includes a change to how scoring
        penalties are calculated. A Scoring Penalty should now be rounded to a single decimal place, like other calculated scores.
        Previously, penalties were rounded to the nearest whole number. The default scoring system in SailScores has been updated
        to comply with the new rules. There are also base systems added for those who need to use the pre-2025 scoring systems.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>December 30th, 2024</h3>
    <h5>&#129346; 2024 Year in Review & Winter updates &#x2746;</h5>
    <h5><em>[Edited on January 23, 2025: no longer suggests two minimal changes were only RRS2025 scoring changes.]</em></h5>
    <p>
        SailScores continues to help plenty of sailing clubs and sailors. 2024 by the numbers:
        <ul>
            <li>32 clubs scored at least one race on the site</li>
            <li> 19 of those were new to SailScores this year</li>
            <li>Over 1700 races were scored in 232 different series</li>
            <li>Over 14,800 individual results were entered.</li>
            <li>
                The year's
                <a href="https://www.sailscores.com/D6BISF/2024/MondayNightRacing"
                   target="_blank">largest series</a> had 62 races.
            </li>
            <li>
                SailScores continues
                to be popular with radio control sailing fleets and other clubs that want
                scores quickly for a single day of sailing; 149 of the series lasted a
                single day. 33 of those had 10 or more races in a single day!
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        The SailScores website had about three hours of slow or failing responses
        during the year. Digging into the cause of those, we had outgrown our
        cloud resources, so we added more server capacity in October. (Turns out
        that calculating discards for Cox-Sprague takes more effort than
        plain ol' Appendix A.)
    </p>
    <h5>Updates</h5>
    <p>
        We neglected to post updates for sites changes made during 2024. They 
        were mostly small bug fixes, with a few obscure new features.
        Today we're adding a few more small features and fixes, getting ready
        for the new Rules (RRS), and setting the site up for other tweaks in 2025.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two small changes bring SailScores closer to compliance with the
        <a href="https://www.sailing.org/inside-world-sailing/rules-regulations/racingrules/"
           target="_blank">Racing Rules of Sailing 2025-2028</a>. The description
        of two Scoring Codes have been changed. The new descriptions (for existing codes) are:
        <dl class="row">
            <dt class="col-sm-2">SCP</dt>
            <dd class="col-sm-10">Scoring Penalty imposed</dd>

            <dt class="col-sm-2">NSC</dt>
            <dd class="col-sm-10">Did not sail the course (other than DNC, DNS, OCS and
                    DNF)
            </dd>
        </dl>
    </p>
    <p>
        For scorekeepers, we've made competitor sorting more consistent through
        the site by sorting as numbers and not alphabetically when possible.
    </p>
    <p> Also for scorekeepers, a couple of settings on the competitor list page
        are now saved for future page loads: the sort order and showing
        competitors that are set of "inactive." 
    </p>
    <p>Here's to a happy and successful 2025 filled with fair winds and speedy sailing!</p>
    <br />
    <h3>December 21st, 2023</h3>
    <h5>&#x1F384; Making a list...</h5>
    <p><i>[published in January 2024, but I wrote this a few weeks ago, and I like the theme too much to change it.]</i></p>
    <p>
        We've started a mailing list for SailScores users. Sign up using the form above
        to receive an occasional email notification of new SailScores features
        and updates as well as tips for using the site.
        Emails won't be very frequent: averaging less than one a month.
    </p>
    <p>
        We'll continue to update this page as significant updates are made as well.
    </p>
    <h5>&#x1F381; and checking it twice...</h5>
    <p>
        "What if we scored this series differently?" The biggest strength of SailScores
        is the instant sharing of results when a race is saved. No messing about
        with copying PDFs or changing file names. But previously, this came
        with a downside: experimenting with different scoring systems might
        change the public-facing results.
    </p>
    <p>
        To address this we've added a new "What if?" feature. Accessible to scorekeepers
        for their club's series, it's tucked in the optional Additional Settings section.
        Instead of changing the series scoring system, use the <b>Try Different Scoring</b>
        button to walk through options to change the scoring system or discards.
        The results will be shown with an indicator to highlight any position changes from
        the currently active scoring system.
    </p>
    <p>
        While this feature won't be used much, it should give clubs
        options and confidence that they are using a solid scoring system.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>
            Note: to try a different system with club specific scoring codes, create
            the system in your club admin page and then use the "Try Different Scoring"
            button.
        </em>
    </p>
    <h5>&#x1F385; Gonna find out who's naughty and nice</h5>
    <p>
        A big behind the scenes update: we've updated the code to .Net 8. If all goes
        according to plan, the only noticeable change be a faster site. Please
        <a href="mailto:info@sailscores.com">let us know</a> if you see any other issues.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>November 18th, 2023</h3>
    <h5>Cox-Sprague Scoring</h5>
    <p>
        <em>[edited to clarify comparison to High Point Percentage.]</em>
        We've added Cox-Sprague scoring as a supported option. In this
        variant of High Point Percentage scoring, results are given more
        weight for top finishes. In addition, race weight is tweaked so that races
        with small participant counts get smaller relative weight than they
        would in straight High Point Percentage. The difference increases as the
        fleet gets smaller: a three boat race contributes triple that of a two boat race.
    </p><p>
        Core to SailScores: races can belong to multiple series, even series that are scored
        differently. With the addition
        of Cox-Sprague, a long-running champ series based on Cox-Sprague can be compiled
        easily at the same time as weekend series scored with Appendix A Low Point. The
        race results need to be entered only once.
    </p><p>
        High Point Percentage systems let competitors miss races without the
        penalty of receiving a low score. A competitor&rsquo;s percentage includes
        only the races they participated in. Scoring can enforce minimum participation
        before a competitor is ranked. SailScores
        allows custom codes that count as participation but are not included in the
        total score. Use this approach for volunteer non-sailing days, e.g., "RC - Race
        Committee Duty".
    </p><p>
        Cox-Sprague discards can be surprising: with race weighting, discarding the
        lowest score or lowest percentage does <em>not</em> always improve a Cox-Sprague percentage total more
        than other potential discards. SailScores calculates the discard that will
        maximize a competitor's total. This is different from some other scoring
        calculators, which determine a less optimal discard.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>November 11th, 2023</h3>
    <p>
        One feature added: after renaming a series, regatta, or competitor, urls based
        on the old name will continue to work. Previously, series and regattas had a "urlName"
        that kept the name of the first save: the url would not necessarily use the current
        series name.
    </p><p>
        This should help with sharing links to the site:
        urls will forward to the new name. If a replacement item is created with the same
        name, the forwarding will stop, and the links will go to the new item.
    </p>
    <p>
        Next up is support for Cox-Sprague scoring: a variant of High Point Percentage.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>November 5th, 2023</h3>
    <h5>&#129411;</h5>
    <p>
        A bunch of fixes and tweaks released today:
        <ul>
            <li>
                Encouraged by the request of a frostbiting club, a few fixes to High Point
                Percentage scoring, that bring SailScores in line with RaceSail&rsquo;s calculations
                for High Point Percentage.
                <ul>
                    <li>High Point Series chart is right side up.</li>
                    <li>High Point Series highlighting is correct</li>
                    <li>Divisor (total competitors that qualify as "Came to starting area") is
                        correctly calculated.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                A couple of new utilities for managing competitors:
                <ul>
                    <li>Ability to bulk inactivate competitors; want to start fresh each season?
                        Just a few clicks now.</li>
                    <li>Ability to clear all competitors' "Alternative Sail Numbers" at once.
                        Alternative Sail Numbers can be used for a single regatta and then
                        removed after the weekend. </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Regattas also got some love: default race numbers are no longer based on the date,
                but are based on how many previous races the selected fleet had in the regatta.
                And more guidance is provided for creating and naming regatta fleets.
            </li>
            <li>A favorite: the ordering of competitors in the score entry textbox has been
                improved. It's now easier to get the right competitor when typing a sail number.
                (Previously the alphabetical sort could get in the way.)
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Division notation is still on the way, and next up are improvements to renaming series and
        regattas. (We plan to have previous names forward to the new regatta url.)
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>
        October 16th, 2023
    </h3>
    <h5>&#128123;</h5>
    <p>
        Today we released some new features:
        <ul>
            <li>Regattas may have documents added, shown right below the notices section. 
                <em>Depending on use and cost, this feature may only be included with a
                    subscription fee in the future.</em></li>
            <li>Clubs can select a localization setting which will alter date and some
                fixed text. <em>This is an experimental feature.</em> Languages other than English
                    may have incomplete translations. Additional languages will be
                    added in the future if interest warrants.</li>
            </li>
            <li>Various bug fixes, particularly around regatta views.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        This winter we expect to add a few more features for regattas, such as simpler regatta
        creation and division scoring within regatta fleets.
    </p>
    <br />
<h3>
    October 21st, 2021
</h3>
<h5>&#127875;</h5>
<p>
    This past season we've been testing a feature near the core of SailScores' goal:
    allowing results to be entered and shared as fast as possible. This has turned
    out to be one of the places where speech recognition can speed things up 
    quite a bit.
</p>
<p>
    So we did it. SailScores result entry now supports speech recognition, both on laptops
    as well as mobile devices. If you are interested in trying this out,
    <a href="mailto:info@sailscores.com">contact us</a> to enable this feature for your club.
</p>
<p>
    The speech recognition is focused on sail numbers and skipper names, and requires an
    internet connection to work. If this becomes popular, we'll come up with a way to share
    the service costs for those that are using it.
</p>
<br />    <h3>
    January 1st, 2021

<h5>Happy New Year!</h5>
<p>
        New
        <a href="https://www.sailing.org/inside-world-sailing/rules-regulations/racing-rules-of-sailing/" target="_blank">Racing
        Rules of Sailing (RRS)</a> became effective today, January 1. There are a couple
        of minor changes to scoring in the new rules. SailScores has been updated to be in compliance
    with the new rules.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>New Score Code: <em>NSC</em>: Did not sail the course.</strong> This
            code may be used by the race committee that observed a boat not completing the course
            correctly. Previously, the Race Committee needed to either protest the boat
            or score them as DNF: did not finish. From a scoring perspective, this code
            is treated the same as "DNF."
            SailScores' scoring systems now have <em>NSC</em> as a scoring code.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Series scoring rule A9 becomes rule 5.3 and has been slightly reworded.</strong>
            Previously rule A9 described how scoring could be changed for a "series longer
            than a regatta." This rule has been moved to A5.3, and now indicates that the
            Sailing Instructions must state that rule A5.3 will apply to be in effect. To
            accommodate this, SailScores default scoring system is now called "Appendix A
            For Series - Rule 5.3"
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>
<br />
    <h3>
        December 23rd, 2020

    <h5>&#10052; &#10052; &#10052; Happy Holidays &#10052; &#10052; &#10052;</h5>
    <p>
        Snow is coming down outside, so no sailing means more time for updates to SailScores.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Many Admin page tweaks</strong> The design of the Club admin page has been updated to
        keep things easier to use and better fit on mobile devices. Other pages on the site may be
        getting similar updates as they are changed.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Browser Analytics</strong> Registered users may now select "Enable Browser Analytics"
        which will send more information about delays and script errors on our pages to SailScores.
        This is not advertising tracking: the information from this setting will only go
        to SailScores.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Dark mode</strong> is now supported. SailScores now uses your browser setting to determine whether
        a light background or dark background should be used. (Many browsers will use the operating
        system setting for this.)
    </p>
    <p>
        Still more work to do. If you're interested in all the details, watch the code at Github.

        And automatic weather information snuck in. Weather info is filled in
        when a race is created or moved from "scheduled" to "raced." Pre-filled
        weather info will be cleared out when the race date is changed.

        In the next few months, SailScores series should gain the ability to have
        overlapping competitor divisions. With this, a regatta can include separate
        results any subset of the sailors, such as youth or single-handed, while still
        showing them in the overall regatta results.

        For example, since the initial go-live clubs haven't expressed much interest
        in importing results from other systems, so time has been spent on better stats
        reporting and improving the result entry UI.

    <h5>Staying at home</h5>
    <p>
        Stay-at-home orders are causing us all to find a new rhythm. While staying safe, the
        <a href="/LHYC/Competitor/2144">competitor</a>
        page finally got some attention, and is now available by clicking on a competitor
        name in series results. Let us know what you think and if there's a stat you
        think would be useful, please let us know.

    <h5>To the cloud...</h5>
    <p>
        Along with changing SailScores' hosting service, a few updates have been made to improve
        site performance. We're still finding some places that can be sped up and expect
        to continue making tweaks to help the site's responsiveness.
    </p>
    <p>
        But for the next few months feature updates will slow down. We're working on a mobile app to support
        offline score entry integrated with this site.

    <em>Weather!</em>
    <p>
        If the location of your club is set, SailScores will download and include the current weather
        conditions when you enter race results. The weather conditions will be displayed in the
        headers of series results, with a wind direction arrow, wind speed and selected icon.

    <h5>New Features</h5>
    <em>Faster creation of multiple competitors.</em>
    <p>
        The page to create competitors now can create multiple competitors at once, and can handle
        competitors pasted from a spreadsheet such as Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel.
    </p>
    <em>Club request page</em>
    <p>
        We're working on speeding up the process of
        <a asp-controller="ClubRequest" asp-action="Index">creating a new club.</a> Requests still
        need to be approved by a person, but the form now gives a better idea of what information
        is needed to initially set up the club.
    </p>
    <em>Admin tips</em>
    <p>
        Guidance for newly setup clubs is now provided as on-page tips suggesting activities
        that should be completed for race scoring.

        Series can now be exported to a stand-alone html page or comma separated file (.csv). Look
        for the buttons in the lower right below a series results.
    </p>
    <em>Create and Merge Competitors</em>
    <p>
        Competitors can now be created while entering a race's results. And if you later discover
        that a racer already existed in the club, the two competitors can be merged.

        Regatta support: a regatta is featured on the front page for a week before and after the event, and
        is highlighted on the club home page for three weeks before and after the event.
    </p>

        A regatta will have fleets of competitors different from the usual club fleets, and will show
        competitors' home clubs.

    <h5>New Features</h5>
    <p>
        Custom Scoring systems are now working.
        <ul>
            <li>
                Three base systems are currently implemented: Appendix A (a.k.a. low point)
                for Series, Appendix A for Regattas, and High Point Percentage.
            </li>
            <li>
                Clubs can implement custom scoring systems that derive from the base
                systems, but customize codes or the discard pattern.
            </li>
            <li>
                A club should have a default scoring system set. (It can be one of the
                built in systems.)
            </li>
            <li>Series can then be set to use a different system.</li>
        </ul>
        Also some enhancements have been made to support long series: helm name is now
        shown every 25 races and as the last column of the results.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>
        June 7th, 2019 Update
    </h3>
    <h5>New Features</h5>
    <p>
        Enhancements to the race editing page are getting rolled out today:
        <ul>
            <li>
                The page automatically scrolls to show the last entered result. (This
                required that the Add Result field get moved toward the bottom of the page.)
            </li>
            <li>
                A few weeks ago we added a field to track scheduled, raced and abandoned
                races. Scheduled and abandoned races don't show up in series views on small
                devices and aren't used for scoring.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Name and Description fields have been moved to Additional Fields section
                that is collapse by default.
            </li>
            <li>
                The format of the result list has been improved, including more details
                score codes.
            </li>
        </ul>
        These changes should make entering results on a phone a much better experience. The changes came
        about after using this with great success for the last several weeks at Lake Harriet.

        SailScores.com is kinda live. There are still features to be added, but the basics are
        working. In the next few months there will be plenty of testing and tweaks. Hopefully
        a few new features as well. If you are interested in helping out with the testing, please
