<h5>Happy New Year!</h5>
<p>
    New <a href="https://www.sailing.org/documents/racingrules/index.php" target="_blank">Racing
    Rules of Sailing (RRS)</a> became effective today, January 1. There are a couple of minor
    changes to scoring in the new rules. SailScores has been updated to be in compliance
    with the new rules.
    <ul>
        <li>
            <strong>New Score Code: <em>NSC</em>: Did not sail the course.</strong> This 
            code may be used by the race committee that observed a boat not completing the course
            correctly. Previously, the Race Committee needed to either protest the boat
            or score them as DNF: did not finish. From a scoring perspective, this code
            is treated the same as "DNF."
            SailScores' scoring systems now have <em>NSC</em> as a scoring code.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Series scoring rule A9 becomes rule 5.3 and has been slightly reworded.</strong>
            Previously rule A9 described how scoring could be changed for a "series longer
            than a regatta." This rule has been moved to A5.3, and now indicates that the
            Sailing Instructions must state that rule A5.3 will apply to be in effect. To
            accommodate this, SailScores default scoring system is now called "Appendix A
            For Series - Rule 5.3"
        </li>
    </ul>
</p>

<h5>&#10052; &#10052; &#10052; Happy Holidays &#10052; &#10052; &#10052;</h5>
<p>
    Snow is coming down outside, so no sailing means more time for updates to SailScores.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Many Admin page tweaks</strong> The design of the Club admin page has been updated to
    keep things easier to use and better fit on mobile devices. Other pages on the site may be
    getting similar updates as they are changed.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Browser Analytics</strong> Registered users may now select "Enable Browser Analytics"
    which will send more information about delays and script errors on our pages to SailScores.
    This is not advertising tracking: the information from this setting will only go
    to SailScores.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Dark mode</strong> is now supported. SailScores now uses your browser setting to determine whether
    a light background or dark background should be used. (Many browsers will use the operating
    system setting for this.)
</p>
<p>
    Still more work to do. If you're interested in all the details, watch the code at Github.

<h5>Summer's over</h5>
<p>
    Here in Minnesota, the sailing season has come to an end for 2020. In the past
    few months we've made some small improvements to performance and stability.
</p>
<p>
    And automatic weather information snuck in. Weather info is filled in
    when a race is created or moved from "scheduled" to "raced." Pre-filled
    weather info will be cleared out when the race date is changed.
</p>
<p>
    In the next few months, SailScores series should gain the ability to have
    overlapping competitor divisions. With this, a regatta can include separate
    results any subset of the sailors, such as youth or single-handed, while still
    showing them in the overall regatta results.
</p>
<p>
    Your thoughts and feature requests are welcome, either by
    <a href="mailto:info@sailscores.com">email</a> or at
    <a href="https://github.com/SailScores/SailScores/issues" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub.</a>
    For example, since the initial go-live clubs haven't expressed much interest
    in importing results from other systems, so time has been spent on better stats
    reporting and improving the result entry UI.

<h5>Staying at home</h5>
<p>
    Stay-at-home orders are causing us all to find a new rhythm. While staying safe, the
    <a href="/LHYC/Competitor/2144">competitor</a>
    page finally got some attention, and is now available by clicking on a competitor
    name in series results. Let us know what you think and if there's a stat you
    think would be useful, please let us know.
</p>

<h5>To the cloud...</h5>
<p>
    Along with changing SailScores' hosting service, a few updates have been made to improve
    site performance. We're still finding some places that can be sped up and expect
    to continue making tweaks to help the site's responsiveness.
</p>
<p>
    But for the next few months feature updates will slow down. We're working on a mobile app to support
    offline score entry integrated with this site.
</p>
<br />
<h3>
    January 23rd, 2020
</h3>
<h5>New Feature</h5>
<em>Weather!</em>
<p>
    If the location of your club is set, SailScores will download and include the current weather
    conditions when you enter race results. The weather conditions will be displayed in the
    headers of series results, with a wind direction arrow, wind speed and selected icon.
</p>
<br />
<h3>
    November 26th, 2019
</h3>
<h5>New Features</h5>
<em>Faster creation of multiple competitors.</em>
<p>
    The page to create competitors now can create multiple competitors at once, and can handle
    competitors pasted from a spreadsheet such as Google Sheets or Microsoft Excel.
</p>
<em>Club request page</em>
<p>
    We're working on speeding up the process of
    <a asp-controller="ClubRequest" asp-action="Index">creating a new club.</a> Requests still
    need to be approved by a person, but the form now gives a better idea of what information
    is needed to initially set up the club.
</p>
<em>Admin tips</em>
<p>
    Guidance for newly setup clubs is now provided as on-page tips suggesting activities
    that should be completed for race scoring.
</p>
<br />
<h3>
    November 19th, 2019
</h3>
<h5>New Features</h5>
<em>Exports</em>
<p>
    Series can now be exported to a stand-alone html page or comma separated file (.csv). Look
    for the buttons in the lower right below a series results.
</p>
<em>Create and Merge Competitors</em>
<p>
    Competitors can now be created while entering a race's results. And if you later discover
    that a racer already existed in the club, the two competitors can be merged.
</p>

</h3>
<h5>New Features</h5>
<em>Series Charts</em>
<p>
    Series with more than one race can show a chart with the trend of competitors' rankings.
</p>
<br />
<h3>
    September 3rd, 2019
</h3>
<h5>New Features</h5>
<p>
    Regatta support: a regatta is featured on the front page for a week before and after the event, and
    is highlighted on the club home page for three weeks before and after the event.
</p>
<p>
    A regatta will have fleets of competitors different from the usual club fleets, and will show
    competitors' home clubs.
</p>
<br />
<h3>
    August 16th, 2019
</h3>
<h5>New Features</h5>
<p>
    Series can include a column with changes in competitors' rankings.
</p><p>
    Historical series can lock results, so that changes in the scoring system or the races will no longer change the series.
</p>
<br />
<h3>
    August 10th, 2019
</h3>
<h5>New Features</h5>
<p>
    Custom Scoring systems are now working.
    <ul>
        <li>
            Three base systems are currently implemented: Appendix A (a.k.a. low point)
            for Series, Appendix A for Regattas, and High Point Percentage.
        </li>
        <li>
            Clubs can implement custom scoring systems that derive from the base
            systems, but customize codes or the discard pattern.
        </li>
        <li>
            A club should have a default scoring system set. (It can be one of the
            built in systems.)
        </li>
        <li>Series can then be set to use a different system.</li>
    </ul>
    Also some enhancements have been made to support long series: helm name is now
    shown every 25 races and as the last column of the results.
</p>
<br />
<h3>
    June 7th, 2019 Update
</h3>
<h5>New Features</h5>
<p>
    Enhancements to the race editing page are getting rolled out today:
    <ul>
        <li>
            The page automatically scrolls to show the last entered result. (This
            required that the Add Result field get moved toward the bottom of the page.)
        </li>
        <li>
            A few weeks ago we added a field to track scheduled, raced and abandoned
            races. Scheduled and abandoned races don't show up in series views on small
            devices and aren't used for scoring.
        </li>
        <li>
            The Name and Description fields have been moved to Additional Fields section
            that is collapse by default.
        </li>
        <li>
            The format of the result list has been improved, including more details
            score codes.
        </li>
    </ul>
    These changes should make entering results on a phone a much better experience. The changes came
    about after using this with great success for the last several weeks at Lake Harriet.

    SailScores.com is kinda live. There are still features to be added, but the basics are
    working. In the next few months there will be plenty of testing and tweaks. Hopefully
    a few new features as well. If you are interested in helping out with the testing, please
