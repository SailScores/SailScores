<h5>Release Notes</h5>
<p>
    Enhancesments to the race editing page are getting rolled out today:
    <ul>
        <li>The page automatically scrolls to show the last entered result. (This
        required that the Add Result field get moved toward the bottom of the page.) </li>
        <li>A few weeks ago we added a field to track scheduled, raced and abandoned
        races. Scheduled and abandoned races don't show up in series views on small
        devices and aren't used for scoring.</li>
        <li>The Name and Description fields have been moved to Additional Fields section
        that is collapse by default.</li>
        <li>The format of the result list has been improved, including more details 
        score codes.</li>
    </ul>
    These changes should make entering results on a phone a much better experience. The changes came
    about after using this with great success for the last several weeks at Lake Harriet.
</p>
<h5>Other News</h5>
<p>We're trying to consolidate our issues lists with the SailScores code at
    <a href="https://github.com/jbfraser1/SailScores/issues" target="_blank">GitHub.</a> Some
    of the issues have a "Help wanted" tag, where we'd love to hear more input from potential users.</p>
<p>The big effort of making the scoring systems customizable through a user interface has started.
    Initially this will focus on supporting low-point scoring, and allowing for customizable
    discard patterns and score code values, but still making sure a single race can be used in 
    multiple series.</p>

    SailScores.com is kinda live. There are still features to be added, but the basics are
    working. In the next few months there will be plenty of testing and tweaks. Hopefully
    a few new features as well. If you are interested in helping out with the testing, please
