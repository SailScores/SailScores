<h3>Sailing scoring kept simple.</h3>
<p>
    SailScores makes publishing sail race results simple and
    fast: simple enough that the scores can be entered and shared
    from a phone on the water. Competitors and clubs should be able to view scores
    in many ways from many devices, and see trends and specifics.
</p>
<br />
<h3>You can use it for free</h3>
<p>
    You can host your club's scores on this site. Fill out <a asp-controller="ClubRequest" asp-action="index">the form</a>
    for the initial club setup. There's no cost.
</p>
<p>
    If you'd rather provide your own servers, SailScores is open-source software. The
    code is available at
    <a href="https://github.com/jbfraser1/SailScores">https://github.com/jbfraser1/SailScores</a>.
    You are welcome to run your own instance of this. I'll provide
    support as time allows.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Free? Really free?</h3>
<p>
    <i>Why is SailScores free? What's the catch? What about "If you're not paying for a service, you are the product."?</i>
</p>
<p>
    The expense to host this site is less than $20 a month.
    Development time is a more significant contribution, but it is happily donated:
    score entry troubles are reduced, the growth of sailing is supported and technologies are learned.
</p>
<p>
    If there is a catch, it might be this: as we build more advanced features, or as the site becomes
    popular, it might not fit into the current inexpensive hosting option. We might need to come up with
    payments for a better server option. That could be done with an option to pay for premium features
    or a SailScores phone app might require purchase.
</p>
<p>
    But we remain committed to providing a free option. The sailing clubs we've participated
    in haven't had large budgets and would have benefitted from SailScores.
</p>
<p>
    By the way, SailScores doesn't use any tracking or cookies except the minimum required to track logged-in users. Your
    data is not being sold by SailScores.
</p>

<h3>Future</h3>
We're working on new features, including:
<ul>
    <li>Integration with social media, such as automatic posting of results to Twitter.</li>
    <li>Fields to track race conditions, with analysis for competitors in different conditions.</li>
    <li>Import and Export to integrate with existing scoring software.</li>
    <li>Deeper trend reporting for clubs: Are your races growing year orver year?</li>
    <li>More options for result entry: let's keep making result entry simpler and faster. We've got even more ideas for this...</li>
</ul>
