<h3>Sailing scoring kept simple.</h3>
<p>
    SailScores makes publishing sail race results simple and
    fast. Simple enough that the scores can be entered and shared
    from a phone on the water. And once they've
    got scores, competitors and clubs should be able to review scores
    in many ways, from many devices, viewing trends and specifics.

<h3>You can use it</h3>
<p>
    SailScores is open-source software. The code is available at
    <a href="https://github.com/jbfraser1/SailScores">https://github.com/jbfraser1/SailScores</a>.
    You are welcome to run your own instance of this on your own server(s). I'll provide
    support as time allows. <b>But even easier:</b> this site can host your club's scores.
    Contact us at any of the email addresses below for more information. This is currently a free
    option and we hope to keep it that way.
