<h1 class="h2">Sailing scoring kept simple.</h1>
<p>
    SailScores makes publishing sail race results simple and
    fast: simple enough that the scores can be entered and shared
    from a phone on the water. Competitors and clubs should be able to view scores
    in many ways from many devices, and see trends and specifics.
</p>
<br />
<h3>It's free</h3>
<p>
    You can host your club's scores on this site. Fill out <a asp-controller="ClubRequest" asp-action="index">the form</a>
    for the initial club setup.
</p>
<p>
    If you'd rather provide your own servers, SailScores is open-source software. The
    code is available at
    <a href="https://github.com/SailScores/SailScores">https://github.com/SailScores/SailScores</a>.
    You are welcome to run your own instance of this. We'll provide
    support as time allows.
</p>
<br />
<h4>What's the catch?</h4>
<p>
    <em>Why is SailScores free? What about "If you're not paying for a service, you are the product."?</em>
</p>
<p>
    The expense to host this site is less than $20 a month.
    Development time is a more significant contribution, but it is happily donated:
    score entry troubles are reduced, the growth of sailing is supported and technologies are learned.
</p>
<p>
    Some day, some features may require more resources or payment to other services (such as
    speech recognition or automatic weather recording.) When that becomes an issue
    we'll find a way to only charge the users of the "Premium" features.
</p>
<p>
    We are committed to providing a free option regardless. Our clubs
    haven't had large budgets and would have benefitted from SailScores. We'd
    like to share.
</p>
<p>
    By the way, SailScores doesn't share any tracking or cookies with third-parties. Your
    data is not being sold by SailScores. See our thorough
    <a asp-controller="Home" asp-action="Privacy">Privacy Policy</a> for more information.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Future</h3>
We're working on new features, including:
<ul>
    <li>Integration with social media, such as automatic posting of results to Twitter.</li>
    <li>Additional analysis for competitors in different conditions.</li>
    <li>More import and export options to integrate with existing scoring software.</li>
    <li>Deeper trend reporting for clubs: Are your races growing year over year?</li>
    <li>More options for result entry: let's keep making result entry simpler and faster.
        We've got even more ideas for this...</li>
</ul>
