<h3>Sailing scoring kept simple.</h3>
<p>
    Sailscores is built around the idea that publishing sail race
    scores should be simple. It should be simple enough that the
    scores can be entered from a phone on the water. And once they've
    got scores, competitors and clubs should be able to review scores
    in many ways, from many devices, viewing trends and specifics.
</p>


Planned features include:
<ul>
    <li>Quick result entry, especially on mobile devices.</li>
    <li>Integration with social media, such as automatic result posting to Twitter.</li>
    <li>Import and Export to integrate with existing scoring software.</li>
    <li>Support for overlapping series. (Races can be included in multiple series.)</li>
    <li>Result trend reporting: Are your races growing?</li>
</ul>
