        A club has been set up for @Model.ClubName at: <br />
        <a href="@clubUrl">@clubUrl</a>
        <br />
    </p>
<p>
    This was set up as a "hidden" club. That means the club won't show up on the
    home page of SailScores, but it is still accessible to any users that have
    the url above. If you haven't already, create an account at
    <a href="@accountUrl">@accountUrl</a> using the email address you provided
    ( @Model.ContactEmail ). That account will have permission to edit this club.
    Additional accounts can be given permission by emailing us.
</p>
<p>
    Someone will take a look at your club set up and, if you provided them, help
    set up the discard pattern and list of boat types you sail.
</p>
    <p>
        There are a few other things, such as the list of competitors, that
        you need to set up before you can score your first race. You'll find
        these listed on the club admin page:
        <a href="@clubUrl/admin/">@clubUrl/admin/</a>
    </p>
