# SailScores


ASP.NET Core website and API for one-design sailboat scores. This is the code
for the site hosted at [sailscores.com][1].

I've been keeping scores for our club for a few years and want to fix a bunch of
weaknesses with the options I've seen for scorekeeping. Much of the software I've seen is
dated, lacking support for mobile devices, expensive, or aimed at scoring a
single regatta as an event.

Sailscores aims to be:
- easy to navigate and bookmark.
- fast to use, particularly for entering new results.
- web and mobile friendly.
- Open REST API: I've got plans for some nicer client software but all using a common, straightforward API.
- Crazy cheap for the foreseeable future. At some point I might ask for help covering expenses. (But I'm not quitting my day job any time soon.)
- On the roadmap: analytics for race data.

This code is designed to be multitenant, and I'm very open to hosting other clubs. Site
is live in spring of 2019. I expect there will be plenty of fixes and enhancements in the next year.

Open source, license not yet determined, but likely to be MIT license. Please contact
@jbfraser1 (jamie@widernets.com) with any interest in using this, and I'll push this up
on my priorities.

Contributions welcome.
