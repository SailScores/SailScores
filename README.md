# SailScores


An ASP.NET Core website and API for sailboat scoring. This is the code
for the site hosted at [sailscores.com][1].

I've been keeping scores for our club for a few years and wanted to fix a bunch of
weaknesses with available options I've seen for scorekeeping. I haven't
seen any other software that has a modern interface, supports mobile devices, is inexpensive, and supports club series scoring as much as regatta scoring. SailScores scratches those itches.

SailScores top priorities:
- easy to navigate and bookmark.
- fast to use, particularly for entering new results.
- web and mobile friendly.
- Open REST API: I have plans for nice client software but all using a common, straightforward API.
- Crazy cheap for the foreseeable future, currently free. At some point
I might ask for help covering expenses. (But I'm not quitting my day job any time soon.)
- On the roadmap: analytics for race and competitor data.

This code supports multiple tenants, including visible and hidden clubs.
I'm very open to hosting other clubs at the public site. The site went live in spring of 2019 and two clubs have been using it for the 2019 season. Enhancements and fixes and enhancements are coming weekly. Some bigger features will get worked on over the 2019-2020 winter.

Contributions welcome. Feedback requested: I'm trying to keep the github issues list current with features I'm working
on; it's nice to prioritize them with input from other users.
